 2. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35711048/issue-with-grabbing-a-flexible-id-from-get-request-and-pass-data-to-controller-i
The challenge has been addressed by pushing the recipe id into the recipe object in api.js. A for loop then iterates over all the responses from the api. There is a click event that then grabs the specific id from the for loop and the "deets" div shows the details of a recipe once the recipe has been clicked.
